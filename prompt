 I want to make a tool called uwu toolkit that runs identical as metasploit for for my made exploits and scripts. that used modules
  for scalability. I want to be able to do stuff like search SMB and it will search all the SMB tools i have made or etc for rdp linuix
  windows and etc. another example would be search enumeration and it will show the enumeration tools like my custom nmap and
  dirsearch tool that i will make. I want to be able to setg to set a global variable within the system as well so it will persist
  outside of the tool and work on the host. create and exegol container and search all the variables in the history file for what its
  looking for. Use exegol as a baseline so when we make a tool it uses those formats for structure. i want a command to show all the
  variables configured globally and have an easy option to change them. once a variable is set have it stored in the tool. for example
  if i want to change my user i can type setg or set user [] and it will list all the users that i previously set so i can scroll down
  and change to the one i want. allow this feature to work for all the variables like password target and etc that are in the history.
  What other good ideas would you recommend for a professional pentest tool and ctf. I am not concerned with multiplayer yet.
